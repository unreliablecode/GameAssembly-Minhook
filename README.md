# GameAssembly Hooking DLL

This project demonstrates how to hook a method from `GameAssembly.dll` using [MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook). It allows you to intercept and replace the functionality of a target function within a DLL.

## Features

- Hooks a target function (`NoPmethod`) within `GameAssembly.dll`.
- Displays a message box when the hooked function is called.
- Example of getting the base address of `GameAssembly.dll` and calculating function offsets.
- Uses the [MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook) library for hooking.

## Requirements

- Windows OS
- Visual Studio (or any compatible C++ compiler)
- [MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook) library (can be installed via NuGet)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Install **MinHook** via NuGet by running the following command in the NuGet Package Manager Console:

   ```sh
   Install-Package minhook
   ```

4. Build the project.

## Usage

1. The hook targets a function within `GameAssembly.dll` at a specific offset.
   - Make sure to replace the placeholder `0x123456` with the actual offset of the `NoPmethod` function in your specific DLL.
   
2. When the hook is triggered, a message box will appear indicating that the method has been called and patched.

3. You can optionally call the original function by uncommenting the `originalNoPmethod();` line in the `HookedNoPmethod` function.

## How It Works

- **DllMain** is the entry point of the DLL. When loaded, it:
  - Retrieves the base address of `GameAssembly.dll`.
  - Hooks the `NoPmethod` function using MinHook.
  
- **MinHook** intercepts the target function and replaces it with the `HookedNoPmethod` function.

- Upon detaching the DLL, the hook is disabled and MinHook is uninitialized.
